= Application Theme

Provides the ability to make changes to the Radiant interface without 
changing the underlying layout file. The Help Inline extension provides 
an example of adding a stylesheet to the interface, but here is a brief example:

  ApplicationController.methods_after_set_javascripts_and_stylesheets << :add_inline_help_files

  def add_inline_help_files
    @stylesheets << 'admin/help'
  end

See http://github.com/saturnflyer/radiant-help_inline-extension/tree/master for the full example.

Why is this important? Because you can change the interface application-wide from your extension.

If you want to build a new interface for a client, but don't want to alter the default layout file,
you can use stylesheets and javascripts to do the work for you.
